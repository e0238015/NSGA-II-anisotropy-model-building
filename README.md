# NSGA-II-anisotropy-model-building

We proposed an integrated approach, where well log and seismic data are used as constraints to build an anisotropy rock-physics model. 
We share data that has been used to produce anisotropy model for shale-gas formation.  
* log2ms.mat: is well log measurements.
* subset.mat: is a 2D subset of angle gather.
